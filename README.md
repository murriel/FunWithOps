# Living the Ops Life

For now, this repository is something of a dumping ground for any useful systems administration, DevOps or utilities and code that I come across or create during the course of work, personal projects and learning.  

The primary purpose for now is to serve as a personal collection of resources. It is in need of general cleanup but I will be adding more info as I go. 

This repository is not generally structured for wide public consumption (yet), but is more a reference for myself so that I remember how to do that one thing that I did six months or six days or six hours ago. More to come as new content is developed and as I extract useful information from sets of documentation and notes that I have accumulated over the years.
