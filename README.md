# Living the Ops Life

For now, this repository is something of a dumping ground for any useful systems administration, DevOps or utilities and code that I come across or create during the course of work, personal projects and learning.  

The primary purpose for now is to serve as a personal collection of resources. It is in need of general cleanup but I will be adding more info ~~and maybe eventually setting this repo to public after scrubbing company-specific details.~~ as I go. This repository is not generally structured for wide public consumption (yet), but is more a reference for myself so that I remember how to do that one thing that I did six months or six days or six hours ago.

More to come as new content is developed and as I extract useful information from sets of documentation and notes that I have accumulated over the years.

# To-Do's
- Table of contents
- Need to get organized and spend a weekend cleaning up this repo
- Maybe add GH-Pages or a friendly front page that converts a markdown table of contents into a nice front-end to access these utilities.  

# Note
This entire repo has quite a bit of digital debris. Need to clean up and get this train back on the tracks.
