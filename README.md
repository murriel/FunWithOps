# Living the Ops Life
This repository is intended to be a personal collection of utilities, scripts, and other resources for systems administration and operations.

More to come as new content is developed and as I extract useful information from sets of documentation and notes that I have accumulated over the years.

# To-Do's
- include a table of contents, possibly with some quick wget links to pull specific scripts on an as-needed basis to servers.
