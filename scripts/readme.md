#To-Do
Compile or create some basic bash scripts with lists of handy-dandy systems performance monitoring tools for fun and profit.  

Well, mostly for fun, and not so much for profit. Although cranky servers aren't actually too much fun either. So to rephrase, scripts to aid in server therapy, care and feeding, and to overall improve your relationship with your server(s).  

Primarily I will be looking at non-scale applications, that is, basic tools that can be used on servers individually, but later might expand to include monitoring resources for large sets of servers. This starts to go into the territory of servers or services just for monitoring.
