# WORK IN PROGRESS  
a journey through the world of data.

## VERSION 1.5

This formerly private repository used to contain a collection of SysAdmin scripts, code snippets, and other reference guides used in work and extra curriculars. 

I did not want to throw away the repository after merging over with another repo (INSERT NAME HERE LATER) so decided to do some cleanup, scrub out any sensitive details, and repurpose this for another project.  

# CURRENT PROJECT/OBJECTIVE:

Education and storytelling through mini data projects, across a wide variety of data structures, databases, data exchange formats and so on.  NOSQL and SQL, small and big data, et cetera.

 I haven't quite defined what this will look like, but hope to move toward frequent minor updates and Continuous Delivery, Rapid Deployment, and [add some other important DevOps-related terms here].

# LATEST 
Cleaning up and flattening this repo. Future TBD.
